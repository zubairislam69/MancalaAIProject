This was done in hackerrank, so the code is based on the assumption that it will get 5 inputs of player id, player1Mancala, player1Marbles, player2Mancala, and player2Marbles after each round. The output will only be the hole number representing the ideal move for the bot to choose after going through the alpha beta pruning algorithm.
